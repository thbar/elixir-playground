I've taken the default app generated by Phoenix and I removed as much as possible.

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Note: I've used `mix deps.unlock --unused` quite a bit.
